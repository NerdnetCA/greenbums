# The Green Bums

The Green Bums are an Elite Dangerous bounty hunting squadron.

## Install

First, install Python.

Next, install Jupyter Lab:

```bash
pip install jupyter
pip install jupyterlab
```

You'll need the "numpy" and "pandas" modules:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```

Run jupyter-lab. You may need to find the script folder and add it to your
Windows PATH variable.  Watch the install messages for a hint as to where the 
script folder installed to.

```bash
jupyter-lab

```
